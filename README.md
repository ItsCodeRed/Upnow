# Upnow

A simple tkinter python application that reminds you to stand!

## Build Instructions

Either run 'python reminders.py' to run the file directly, or you can build the file into an executable by running 'python setup.py build'.

## Usage

To use the app, simply set how often you would like to be reminded to stand, and how long you'd like to stand for, then click 'apply'.
The app shows the next six stand times in the bottom left, and the next stand time in the bottom right. When it is time to stand,
the app will let you know by maximizing and staying full screen until the stand time is over. You can also configure the app in the 
remminders.py file to only remind you to stand if you aren't using any application from a list of applications.
